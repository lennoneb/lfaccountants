<!-------------  UX ------------->
## UX
### External users and their goals
The main external users are potential clients. Potential clients visit the site to learn more about the organisation, to see if it is a fit for them and their needs, will they benefit and if so how to take action to start a relationship.

The other users are existing clients, giving them a place where they can go to get the contact details for the firm, learn more via articles, share its details with others and to learn if the firm offers other services that might be useful to them. Long term it could also even link to a client portal for clients e.g. where they could get a dashboard on their financials, raise queries through, etc.!

### Site owners and their goals
The site owners are the firm’s owners. Their goal is to have a place where clients and potential clients can go to learn more about them and what they offer, and provide a pathway for them to go from a potential client to paying client. It is a way of both collecting and screening leads, and a place for creating a perception of expertise (and validation) in the marketplace via blog posts, etc.

### Wireframe  
Initial wireframe mock-ups were developed on Balsamiq. See [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JvGdflXg_joDnUOBAT5wxtcLvbQ8TU1a)

<!------------- Features ------------->
## Features
### Existing Features  
* Feature 1 – Booking form – allows users to submit their contact details with a message to the firm requesting a consultation meeting
* Feature 2 – Newsletter signup - allows users to sign up to the firm’s newsletter, thereby creating a leads list for the firm and allow external users who are not yet ready to commit to an appointment, to warm up to the firm’s services and assess them in part based on the quality of the newsletter

### Features Left to Implement
* Replace the image in welcome section with a video created by the firm featuring members of it’s team, giving a brief overview of the firm, what it does and who it’s for. Once developed change this from hidden when looking on a mobile to visible.
* Link in book an appointment buttons to calendly service or similar
